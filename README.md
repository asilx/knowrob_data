knowrob_data
============

Repository for data related to the KnowRob knowledge base, such as maps,
robot log data or object models. The aim of this collection is to make sample
data, test data, evaluation data and common experiment data sets available
via one repository. At the same time, this data should be stored separately
from code (e.g. not in the main KnowRob repository) in order to allow the
re-use of programs in different contexts.

The subfolders contain the following kinds of data:
* **actions:** OWL files with task descriptions, similar to the "action recipes" in RoboEart
* **logs:** Log files of task executions, either by robots or humans
* **maps:** Semantic environment maps
* **objects:** Object models, i.e. OWL files describing their semantic properties, composition from parts, or links to CAD models
